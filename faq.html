                    <p>Our sites are custom-built; no WordPress or anything like that. Because of this, most clients prefer for us to handle updates for them.

                    <p>With our maintenance package, you get two revisions per month included. This includes minor content updates, design tweaks and text changes.
                        It does not include major redesigns or adding new pages. Most updates are done within 1-3 days. Unused revisions do not roll over to the next month.
